### Question 1: What is OOP and what are the advantages over procedural programming?

OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming. Procedural programming is a process where the program follows a linear set of instructions.

The advantages of OOP over procedural programming are:

* With the code being organised into objects / classes, it creates a code base that is easier to maintiain and upgrade
* Having code broken into objects, that are organised according to their specific function, it allows teams of developers to work in tandem on bigger applications, particularly with the added use of Namespacing.
* Objects / classes can be easily reused in other projects
* It allows for the development of more complex applications that at the same time flexible.
* It helps to facilitate programming paradigms such a MVC ( Model, View, Controller)

### Question 2: What is a TDD methodology?

TDD stands for Test Driven Development. From what I understand this methodology involves, a process of creating a series of tests depicting different scenarios / user cases for a particular function to pass against.

The process continues with a cycle of refactoring code and running tests until, the function has passed the test of all the defined user cases.
